PRO VERSION CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE

-----------------------------------
[ONLY for KZ_ / XC_ MAPS]
[ONLY TICKRATE 102.4 SUPPORTED -> srcds parameter -tickrate 102.4]

I have the feeling that kz maps are a bit too easy in csgo but i don't want to change the settings of kztimer because all players are accustomed to them. 
Therefore, i have created a pro edition of kztimer which makes climing in csgo a lot harder and consistent. The movement feels very similiar to 1.6 now!

Differences to standard edition:
- only tickrate 102.4 supported (Why? Tickrate 64 makes bunnyhops a bit random and Tickrate 128 gives u too much speed while you are in mid-air.)
- pro edition got his own global top
- new movement settings makes climbing a lot harder but also consistent (cs 1.6)
- settings enforcer and prestrafe can't be disabled. Those features are hard-coded in the pro edition.
- removed kz_settings_enforcer, kz_fpscheck, kz_prestrafe, kz_force_jump_penalty, kz_max_prespeed_bhop_dropbhop, kz_auto_timer, kz_auto_bhop, kz_speed_cap
